# Introduction 

The nomisr package is an easy way to obtain data from Nomis. In this introduction you can see some of the functionality of the tool to create bespoke charts. These charts use Bolton as the area of interest.

# Querying data availability

The first step is to understanding what datasets are available in `nomisr` and this can be done using the `nomis_get_info()` function. If no particular id is inputted inside the brackets, the command will return all available datasets.

```{r packages, echo=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(nomisr)

```

```{r all_datasets, echo=TRUE}

nomis_data <- nomis_data_info() %>%
  select(id, description.value, name.value)
head(nomis_data)

```

This gives you a list of all available datasets in nomis. The list of ids/datasets used in this script are:

+ NM_17_5   (Annual Population Survey (APS): contains data on the working age population, economic activity & inactivity)

+ NM_134_1  (Benefit Claimants - Employment and Support Allowance (ESA): contains data on ICDGP condition by ESA)

If you wanted to look at more information on a specific dataset, you can add this inside the bracket of the `nomis_get_info()` function or use the `nomis_get_metadata()` function. Both of these will provide you with the different options (concepts) available for your chosen dataset.

```{r APS_Dataset, echo=TRUE}

NM_17_5 <- nomis_data_info("NM_17_5") 
tibble::glimpse(NM_17_5)


NM_17_5 <- nomis_get_metadata("NM_17_5")
head(NM_17_5)

```

# Querying data variables

## Getting concepts:

As mentioned previously, the `nomis_get_info()` and `nomis_get_metadata()` functions will provide you with a list of concepts that we can explore further to see what data is available e.g. dates, measures, geographies and variables. The concepts will differ depending on your chosen dataset, so it is a good idea to run the `nomis_get_metadata()` for each new dataset you are looking at. 

To explore the concepts we need to specify this in the code. For example to explore the dates available in the APS dataset, we need to specify the concept as "time". 

```{r Exploring_Dates, echo=TRUE}

NM_17_5_DATES <- nomis_get_metadata("NM_17_5", concept = "time") 
tail(NM_17_5_DATES)

```

Instead of referring to the ids for the specific dates you can also use the following options:

+ latest - latest available data
+ previous - the date prior to the latest
+ previousMINUS2 etc. - two quarters ago
+ prevyear - the date one year prior to the latest
+ first - the oldest available data for the dataset

To explore the variables available in the APS dataset, we need to specify the concept as "variable". 

```{r Exploring_Variables, echo=TRUE}

NM_17_5_VARIABLE <- nomis_get_metadata("NM_17_5", concept = "variable") 
head(NM_17_5_VARIABLE)

```

To have a look at what geographies are available in the APS dataset, we need to specify the concept as "geography". 

```{r Exploring_Geography, echo=TRUE}

NM_17_5_GEOG <- nomis_get_metadata("NM_17_5", concept = "geography") 
head(NM_17_5_GEOG)

```

This gives the top level geographies available but if we wanted to identify what type of geographies are available, we would need to use 'type' in the code.

```{r Exploring_Geography_Type, echo=TRUE}

NM_17_5_GEOG <- nomis_get_metadata("NM_17_5", concept = "geography", "type") 
head(NM_17_5_GEOG)

```

If you wanted all local authorities, combined authorities and regions in England, it is easier to create a vector which you can then feed into the `nomis_get_data()` function.

```{r Creating_Geography_Vector, echo=TRUE}

EN_LAs <- nomis_get_metadata(id = "NM_17_5", concept = "geography",
                             type = "TYPE464")[1:326, ] %>%
  mutate(type = 464)
EN_CAs <- nomis_get_metadata(id = "NM_17_5", concept = "geography",
                             type = "TYPE442") %>%
  mutate(type = 442)
EN_Regions <- nomis_get_metadata(id = "NM_17_5", concept = "geography",
                                 type = "TYPE480")[1:9, ] %>%
  mutate(type = 480)
EN_Country <- nomis_get_metadata(id = "NM_17_5", concept = "geography",
                                 type = "TYPE499")[3, ] %>%
  mutate(type = 499)

# use rbind to combine all of the above objects together to create a single object containing all geographies of interest and select only the id, parentCode, label.en and type  
EN_geos <- rbind(EN_LAs, EN_CAs, EN_Regions, EN_Country) %>%
  select(id, parentCode, label.en, type)
print(EN_geos)

# Save it as a vector so can plug it into nomis_get_data function
EN_geographies <- c(1946157057:1946157382, 1853882369:1853882372,
                    1853882374:1853882379, 2013265921:2013265929, 2092957699)

```

# Downloading data

Now you have enough information to use the `nomis_get_data()` function. 

+ Step 1: specify the id/dataset of interest - in this example the NM_17_5 (APS) dataset is used
+ Step 2: set the year of interest - in this example the date has been set to 'latest' available 
+ Step 3: select geography of interest - in this example the vector 'EN_geographies' created earlier is used
+ Step 4: select the variable(s) of interest - in this example the working age population aged 16-64 years [id = 18] has been selected
+ Step 5: select the measures of interest - in this example all measures available are pulled

```{r working_age_pop, echo=TRUE}

working_age_pop <- nomis_get_data(id = "NM_17_5", date = "latest",
                                  geography = EN_geographies,
                                  variable = 18,
                                  measures = c(20599, 21001, 21002, 21003))
print(working_age_pop)

```

## Stacked bar chart showing labour market summary for Bolton

The following steps show how to make a stacked bar chart, which will show:

Stack 1: working age population

+ Economic activity rate - aged 16-64 [id=18]

Stack 2: economically active and economically inactive

+ Unemployment rate - aged 16-64 (economically active will be the denominator) [id=84]
+ % who are economically inactive - aged 16-64 [id=111]

Stack 3: employed, unemployed, want a job, don't want a job

+ Employment rate - aged 16-64 [id=45]
+ Unemployment rate - aged 16-64 [id=84]
+ % of economically inactive who want a job [id=1487] 
+ % of economically inactive who do not want a job [id=1488]

Stack 4: economically active, long term sick, temp sick, student, looking after family/home, retired, other, discouraged

+ Unemployment rate - aged 16-64 (economically active will be the denominator) [id=84]
+ % of economically inactive student [id=1493]
+ % of economically inactive looking after family/home [id=1494]
+ % of economically inactive temporary sick [id=1495]
+ % of economically inactive long-term sick [id=1496]
+ % of economically inactive discouraged [id=1497]
+ % of economically inactive retired [id=1498]
+ % of economically inactive other [id=1499]

The data extracted is for all of the geographies outlined in the 'EN_geographies' vector, but the chart is filtered for Bolton only.

## Pie charts showing economic activity in Bolton 

The following steps show how to make pie charts, which will show:

Pie 1: Economic activity of 'Healthy' working age population (16-64 years)

+ Employment rate - aged 16-64 [id=45]
+ Unemployment rate - aged 16-64 [id=84]
+ % who are economically inactive - aged 16-64 [id=111]

Pie 2: Economic activity of 16+ population with health conditions & illnesses lasting more than 12 months

+ % In employment with health conditions or illnesses lasting more than 12 months (16+) [id=1715]
+ % Unemployed with health conditions or illnesses lasting more than 12 months (16+) [id=1716]
+ % Inactive with health conditions or illnesses lasting more than 12 months (16+) [id=1717]

The data extracted is for all of the geographies outlined in the 'EN_geographies' vector, but the chart is filtered for Bolton only. 

```{r Pie_Charts, echo=TRUE}

# Economic activity of the 'healthy' working age population (16-64): Pie 1

## Treemap showing ESA claimants by specific conditions in Bolton  

The following steps show how to create a treemap: 

+ Step 1: Identify which conditions contribute the most to ESA claimants and rank them
+ Step 2: Extract conditions to map on to treemap and create appropriate age-groups
+ Step 3: Join two tables together to identify highest contributary conditions

The data extracted is for all of the geographies outlined in the 'EN_geographies' vector, but the chart is filtered for Bolton only.

```{r Treemap, echo=TRUE}

# Step 1: Contribution of conditions to total ESA claims

# get ESA data by condition for latest data, call object ESA_data_condition
# Note: the 'totals' (ID = 0) isn't the sum of the values in the dataset - hence hasn't been included in the code:
ESA_data_condition <- nomis_get_data(
